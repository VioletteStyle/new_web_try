We saw a lot of new ideas from ss19 runaway and fashion weeks. My favorite style for this year is absolutely ***box handbag***.   

I bought 2 cute box-handbag from Zara and Urbanoutfitters. I just couldn't get rid of them!

This is the one from Zara. I really fall in love with the deliberately mixed color and the texture of it.

Guess what. It just goes so well with all the spring items in my closet. Especially the blue striped blouse.

Or a caramel sauce.
