We saw a lot of great new ideas from ss19 runaway and fashion weeks. My favorite style for handbag this year is absolutely ***box handbag***.   

I bought 2 cute box-handbags from Zara and Urbanoutfitters. They add some spring vibes for your outfit effortlessly. I just can't get rid of them!

This is the one from Zara. It is not that kind of "eye-catcher" handbag but you can not overlook it when shopping in Zara. I really fall in love with the deliberately mixed color and the texture of it.

The fact is, it just goes so well with all the spring items in my closet. Especially the blue striped blouse.

I found out that the crochet is coming back this year, so a texture involving delicate **"handmade""** concept will definitely become more popular this year. Unsurprisingly, many popular brands have released their new collections of "handmade edition". How wonderful is that!
