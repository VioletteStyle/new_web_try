    **Do**

    1. Keep using basic yet well-designed single items, i.e. simple jeans, white shirts, basic blouses, etc.
    2. Choose clean colors, such as white, camel, grey.
    3. Add some high-light into the whole outfit by simple colors, such as burgendy, maroon, or navy blue.
    4. Keep comfortable and cool.
    5. Insist your own personal style and keep the "I don't care" attitude towards trend and fashion.

    **Do not**
    1. Combine more than three colors in one outfit, except white, black & grey.
    2. Keep trying something in trend, especially the overstatement stuff.
    3. Wear flashy Logos.
    4. Wear sky-high heels.
    5. Look like you are trying **too much**

If you're a fitness fan you're going to love this style. Athleisure style is one of my favorite year-round outfit, but it is a perfect choice for winter and early-spring, when everyone tends to blend sporty into casual outfits.
