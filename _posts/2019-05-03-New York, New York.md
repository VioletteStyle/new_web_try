We saw a lot of great new ideas from ss19 runaway and fashion weeks. My favorite style for handbag this year is absolutely ***box handbag***.   

I bought 2 cute box-handbags from Zara and Urbanoutfitters. They add some spring vibes for my outfit effortlessly. I just can't get rid of them!

This is the one from Zara. It is not that kind of "eyes-catch" handbag but you can not overlook it when shopping in Zara. I really fall in love with the deliberately mixed color and the comfy texture of it.

The fact is, it just goes so well with all the spring items in my closet. Especially the blue striped blouse.

I found out that the crochet is coming back this year, so a texture involving delicate **"handmade"** concept will definitely become more popular this year. Unsurprisingly, many popular brands have released their new collections of "handmade edition". How wonderful is that!

Another thing I found is this cute orange handbag from Urbanoutfitters. I was attracted by the color at the first view. ***Orange*** is just so good for spring!

Also, the head-to-toe nude outfit is in trend this spring, but it is never too cliche to add some fancy color to break the monochroma. I would like a bright handbag.

Don't forget the shoes! I chose a pair of orange string sandal to match the color of the bag! Cute, isn't it?

Hope you will find your personal bag for this spring!
