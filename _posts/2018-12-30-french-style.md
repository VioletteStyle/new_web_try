    **Do**

    1. Keep using basic yet well-designed single items, i.e. simple jeans, white shirts, basic blouses, etc.
    2. Choose clean colors, such as white, camel, grey.
    3. Add some high-light into the whole outfit by simple colors, such as burgendy, maroon, or navy blue.
    4. Keep comfortable and cool.
    5. Emphasize on the quality not quantity.
    6. Insist your own personal style and keep the "I don't care" attitude towards trend and fashion.

    **Do not**
    1. Combine more than three colors in one outfit, except white, black & grey.
    2. Keep trying something in trend, especially the overstatement stuff.
    3. Wear flashy Logos.
    4. Wear sky-high heels.
    5. Look like you are trying **too much**

French Style is all about **effortless**. Remember what Oscar de la Renta said, *"Fashion is about dressing according to whatâ€™s fashionable. Style is more about being yourself."*
